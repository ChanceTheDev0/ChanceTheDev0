-  Hi, my name's Chance I’m interested in advancing my skill set and moving forward with the world of technology.

-  I’m currently learning web development. Ive completed a few courses on web development fundamentals, responsive web design, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.      Now I'm studying with The Odin Project. I've learned how to use git, github, Unix CLI, vscode, and browser dev tools. I'm proficient in HTML and CSS, 
   I understand JS and I'm still learning to write it more effectively. 

-  I’m pursuing the knowlegde to obtain a career in the field while cultivating a passion for the technology. I'd be happy to learn more from any project 
   or mentor and get more acclimated to working in this field and with a team on github. At the moment I'm studying with The Odin Project and in the future    I'd like to branch out to more technologies like python and learn about fields like data science in the future.
